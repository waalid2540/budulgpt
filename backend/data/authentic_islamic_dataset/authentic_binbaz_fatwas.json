    "question": "Is it permissible to use credit cards with interest?",
    "answer": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم\n\nUsing credit cards that involve interest (riba) is prohibited in Islam. Allah says: 'Allah has permitted trade and forbidden riba (usury/interest).' [Quran 2:275]\n\nHowever, if one uses a credit card and pays the full amount before the due date without incurring any interest charges, this may be permissible according to some scholars.\n\nIt is better to avoid such contracts altogether and use:\n1. Debit cards\n2. Cash payments\n3. Islamic banking alternatives\n\nالله أعلم",
